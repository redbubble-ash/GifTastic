On this web page, you will see a little more about your favorite city! 

On the top of the page, there are ten buttons that have different city names in the world. When the user clicks on a button, the page should display 10 static, non-animated gif images with the image's title and rating from the GIPHY API, which relates to the city that the user clicked. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing. 

The user can also add a city button by entering a city name in the "Add a City" box on the right side of the page. Once it has been submitted, the new city button should display on the button list.
